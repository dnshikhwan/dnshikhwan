Hi there, I'm Danish! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a full-time software engineering student and aspiring backend & AI developer with a deep passion for understanding and building efficient, impactful applications. My journey has been driven by a commitment to mastering each line of code and continuously expanding my knowledge across various technologies.

👨‍🎓 About Me
Current Student in Russia 🇷🇺, tackling an intense schedule and language challenges with resilience.
Backend & AI Developer in Training: Pursuing a dual focus on backend development and AI implementation in Java.
Committed to Learning: I’m currently working through a 387-topic Java course, with 110 topics completed so far!
Hands-On: I prefer to write every line of code from scratch for a deep understanding rather than copying or referencing. This approach allows me to stay original and build my own solutions.
💻 Projects & Skills
Languages & Frameworks: Java, C, PostgreSQL, Django, Tailwind CSS
Database Work: Working on multi-table queries and subqueries in PostgreSQL.
Algorithm Optimization: Recently optimized the Bellman-Ford algorithm with early termination and negative cycle detection.
AI Integration: Working towards incorporating AI solutions into backend projects for a holistic developer skill set.
🌟 Recent & Ongoing Projects
Operating Systems: Developing terminal-based programs in C, such as process handlers and file archivers.
Java Mini Projects: Creating daily projects, like to-do lists and games, to strengthen my backend foundation and get feedback.
Game Development: Building interactive games in Java, like Rock-Paper-Scissors, with custom element options.
Database Labs: Applying SQL skills in tasks like displaying relational data across departments and products in complex setups.
🌱 Goals
Backend Development Mastery: I'm aiming to build a solid backend foundation with Java, progressing through hands-on projects and feedback.
AI Development: I'm passionate about blending backend and AI to create powerful, data-driven applications.
Real-World Applications: Exploring project ideas, including a web app with AI for my final year project.
⚙️ Side Projects
File Submission & Payment System: Built a system for students to upload files, calculate page counts, and handle payments using Django and Tailwind CSS.
Video Editing for Events: Created teasers and cyberpunk-themed visuals for events like Talent Night.
📘 Fun Facts
Problem Solver: I enjoy cracking complex algorithms, like the Bellman-Ford, and tweaking them for performance.
Originality Advocate: I stick with my own code, focusing on minimal corrections to maintain originality.
Constant Learner: I seek detailed explanations that start simply and go deep, making complex concepts easy to digest.
